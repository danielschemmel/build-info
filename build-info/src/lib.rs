/**
Generates a string at compile-time that includes build information.

This function-like macro takes a single string-literal as its argument, on which it performs string interpolation with
the current build information. To do so, you can use a subset of the normal format language, with the special
"variable" `$` that denotes the `BuildInfo` object. For example, `build_info::format!("Built at {}", $.timestamp)`
might return "Built at 2020-05-28 20:09:40Z".`

You can use `?` to unwrap `Option`s and some additional types can be formatted this way (e.g., `Vec<T>`).

Literal curly braces can be printed by doubling them up: `build_info::format!("{{}}") // yields "{}"`.
