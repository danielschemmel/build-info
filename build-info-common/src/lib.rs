/*!
Common types used by the `build-info` and `build-info-build` crates.

User code should not depend on this crate directly, but rather depend on `build-info` (as a `[dependency]`) and `build-info-build` (as a `[build-dependency]`).
The types provided herein are reexported by `build-info` and should be used that way.
For example, `build_info_common::BuildInfo` should be used as `build_info::BuildInfo` instead.
